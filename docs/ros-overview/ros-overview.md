# Ridge Object Storage Service

[Ridge Object Storage](https://www.ridge.co/storage) (ROS) offers object storage in multiple locations around the world. 
It is a fully managed web service.

The unique locations that the Ridge cloud provides allow the objects to be stored in proximity to applications that need to run close to the users.

The objects that the user uploads are organized in buckets. A bucket is created within a project.

Developers will find this service easy to use because it supports the S3 API. This also helps in migration of applications between clouds. The S3 API does not have the notion of a project and therefore a member will need separate credentials for each project.

The Ridge console offers a convenient way to manage S3 access keys and buckets.
