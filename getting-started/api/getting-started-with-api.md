# Getting Started with the Ridge API

Welcome to the Ridge developer API guide.  This guide will explain the core concepts necessary for using Ridge resources


The Ridge API is a RESTFUL API that uses JSON encoding. All API requests must include a token in the header for authentication. The token is obtained using the Ridge console, and placed in the HTTP Authorization request header:
Authorization: Bearer <Token>


## API Conventions
### Resources identifiers
Ridge resources can be identified by an unique Id, an identifier which is generated by Ridge and may not be modified

For example, describe a Kubernetes cluster:

GET  https://api.ridge.co/rks/experimental/clusters/cluster/<CLUSTER ID>

### Display Name
Each Ridge resource can have a display_name that is used only for display (UI) purpose.
display_name may include up to 512 Unicode characters, include up to 64 lowercase latin letters, numbers or dashes.
