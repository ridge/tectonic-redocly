# Ridge Developer API Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Ridge developer API guide. This guide will explain the core concepts necessary for using Ridge resources and describe the APIs that make up our service. Ridge is developer focused and as such all services are built API firs.
If you are new to Ridge and want a step by step guide that walks through the process of creating and running your first workload, please refer to the Developer Getting Started Guide here.

## Core Concepts

In this section we describe the core concepts you should be familiar with when working with the Ridge Cloud.
What is Ridge?
Ridge offers cloud services based on data centers that are located across the globe. Ridge does not own any of these data centers. They are owned by local service providers. You can choose to deploy your services in any of these locations. Ridge offers managed Kubernetes and container services in all the locations.

### Resource Management

Ridge resources are managed by using a hierarchical structure. Ridge provides Orgs and Projects for grouping and managing resources. Ridge provides Groups for conveniently managing access to resources.
